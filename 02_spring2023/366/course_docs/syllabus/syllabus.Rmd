**Course description:**
This course, taught fully in Spanish, introduces students to a variety of second language teaching methodologies and their evolution as a result of world events and their impact on research in the field of second language acquisition. 
Emphasis is placed on the understanding and implementation of communicative methods of language teaching, the design and development of content-related thematic units based on the New Jersey standards for world language teaching, the ACTFL guidelines, and Standards for the 21st century. 
The use of technology and integrated performance assessment will be included in the course.


**Learning Goals:**
In accordance with our Department Learning Goals, http://span-port.rutgers.edu/learning-goals, students in this course will improve their interpretive, interpersonal and presentational skills. 
They will be exposed to a large quantity of historical and practical information from a variety of textual and online sources that will be introduced by the instructor, as well as by the students themselves, and presented for discussion in pairs or small groups. 
The vocabulary of educational research and design will be introduced and used in context in addition to high frequency vocabulary on every topic customarily found in the instruction of novice and intermediate level learners. 
Students will be expected to design and demonstrate their potential for implementing a standards-based thematic unit on a topic of their choice for a target audience at the novice-mid proficiency level.
