# Sample: Teaching Methods and Student's Role

"**Communicative approach**:

I believe in the importance of a "Communicative approach" and the concept of "Active" students versus Passive students. 

a. Active students. If your students are highly motivated, they are usually quite active. Being active in any communicative aspect is essential: listening, speaking, writing, reading, and interacting. I tried to look for a way to motivate my students by trying to learn about their interests and offering them a selection of practical and cultural topics that the students would find easy to engage in. 

b. Communicative approach. I believe it is important to offer the students the widest range of possibilities to communicate. In other words, I think we should try to model our time with the students after a real situation that would require communication: to claim a lost suitcase from the airplane company, to be able to manage a work meeting, or to have a nice chat with the man who works at the drink stand."
