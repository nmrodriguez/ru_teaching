# Parte 1: Teorias de SLA


---
# Empezamos primero con teorías de adquisición de lenguas (L1)

- Behavioristic Approaches

- The Nativist Approach 

- Functional Approaches

---
# Empezamos primero con teorías de adquisición de lenguas (L1)

- **Behavioristic Approaches**

- The Nativist Approach 

- Functional Approaches

---
# Teorías de adquisición de lenguas (L1)

- **Behavioristic Approaches**

--

- Focuses on the immediately perceptible aspects of linguistic behavior  and the relationships or associations between those responses and events in the world surrounding them

- Effective language behavior: production of correct responses to stimuli

- Verbal Behavior (1957)

- stimulus-response (S-R) theory
---
# Teorías de adquisición de lenguas (L1)

- **Behavioristic Approaches**

- Mediation Theory: modified theoretical positions 

  - the linguistic stimulus (a word or sentence) elicits a "mediating" response that is self-stimulating 
  
- In general: Behavioristic approaches failed to account for the abstract nature of language, for learner (children's) creativity, and for the interactive nature of language acquisition

- Behavioristic Approaches

- **The Nativist Approach** 

- Functional Approaches

---
# Teorías de adquisición de lenguas (L1)

- **The Nativist Approach** 

--

- Fundamental assertation is that language acquisition is innately determined, that we are born with a genetic capacity that predisposes us to a systematic perception of language around us, resulting in the construction of an internalized system of langauge 

---
# Teorías de adquisición de lenguas (L1)

- **The Nativist Approach** 

- Eric Lennenberg (1967) proposed that language is a "species-specifc" behavior and that certain modes of perception, categorizing abilities, and other language-related mechanisms are biologically determined

- Chomsky (1965) claimed there are innate properties of langauge to explain a child's mastery of a native language in suc a short time despite the highly abstract nature of the rules of langauge.

  - Language acquisition device 
  
    - the ability to distinguish speech sounds from other sounds in the environment 
    
    - the ability to organize linguistic data into various classes that can later be refined 
    
    - knowledge that only a certain kind of linguistic system is possible and that other kinds are not, and 
    
    - the ability to engage in constant evaluation of the developing linguistic system so as to construct the simplest possible system out of the available linguistic input
    
---
# Teorías de adquisición de lenguas (L1)

- **The Nativist Approach**

- Universal Grammar: all human beings are genetically equipped with abilities that enable them to acquire language

---
# Empezamos primero con teorías de adquisición de lenguas (L1)

- Behavioristic Approaches

- The Nativist Approach 

- **Functional Approaches**
---

# Teorías de adquisición de lenguas (L1)

- **Functional Approaches** 

--

- Researchers began to see that language was one manifestation of the cognitive and affective ability to deal with the world, with others, and with the self.

- The generative rules that were proposed under the nativisitic framework were abstract, formal, explicit, and quite logical, yet they dealt specifically with the forms of language and not with deeper functional levels of meaning constructed from social interaction

---
# Teorías de adquisición de lenguas (L1)

- **Functional Approaches** 

- Cognition and language development 

- Social interaction and language development 

---
# Teorías de adquisición de lenguas (L1)

- Issues in L1 acquisition:

  - Competence and performance
  
  - Comprehension and production
  
  - Nature or Nurture?
  
  - Universals 
  
  - Systematicity and variability
  
  - Language and thought
  
  - Imitation
  
  - Practice
  
  - Input
  
  - Discourse

# SLA

- Ya que sabemos que aprender un segundo idioma es un proceso complejo, vamos a ver que se debe incluir en una teoría de SLA

--

1. A theory of SLA includes an understanding, in general, of what language is, what learning is, and for classroom contexts, what teaching is.

--

2. Knowledge of children's learning of their first language provides essential insights to an understanding of SLA.

--

3. However, a number of important differences between adult and child learning and between first and second language acquisition must be carefully accounted for. 

--

4. Second language learning is a part of and adheres to general principles of human learning and intelligence. 

--

5. There is tremendous variation across learners in cognitive style and within a learner in strategy choice.

---
# SLA (cont.)

6. Personality, the way people view themselves and reveal themselves in communication, will affect both the quantity and quality of second language learning.

--

7. Learning a second culture is often intricately intertwined with learning a second language. 

--

8. The linguistic contrasts between the native and target language form one source of difficulty in learning a second language. But the creative process of forming an interlanguage system involves the learner in utilizing many facilitative sources and resources. Inevitable aspects of this process are errors, from which learners and teachers can gain further insight. 

--

9. Communicative competence, with all of its subcategories, is the ultimate goal of learners as they deal with function, discourse, register, and nonverbal aspects of human interaction and linguistic negotiation.

# Teoría #1: An innatist model: Krashen's input hypothesis

- Son 5 hipotesis que se relacionan

  - The Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis
  
  - The Monitor Hypothesis
  
  - The Natural Order Hypothesis
  
  - The Input Hypothesis
  
  - The Affective Filter Hypothesis 

---
# Teoría #1: An innatist model: Krashen's input hypothesis

- Son 5 hipotesis que se relacionan

  - **The Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis**: Adult L2 learners have 2 means for internalizing the target language. #1 = acquisition, #2 = conscious "learning"
    
    - "Fluency in L2 performance is due to what we have acquired, not what we have learned"
    
    - "Our conscious learning processes and our subconscious acquisition processes are mutually exclusive: learning cannot "become" acquisition
    
---
# Teoría #1: An innatist model: Krashen's input hypothesis

- Son 5 hipotesis que se relacionan

  - **The Monitor Hypothesis**: the "monitor" is involved in learning, not in acquisition. It is a device that monitors output for editing and making alterations and corrections as they are consciously perceived 
  
    - Fluency is established should an optimal amount of monitoring or editing be employed by the learner 
    
---

# Teoría #1: An innatist model: Krashen's input hypothesis

- Son 5 hipotesis que se relacionan

  - **The Natural Order Hyptohesis**: we acquire language rules in a predictable or "natural" order

# Teoría #1: An innatist model: Krashen's input hypothesis

- Son 5 hipotesis que se relacionan

  - **The Input Hypothesis**: an important condition for language acquisition to occur is that the acquirer needs to understand input language that contains structure "a bit beyon" his or her current level of competence
  
    - i + 1
    
    - inmersión total
    
    - comprehensible input
    
---
# Teoría #1: An innatist model: Krashen's input hypothesis

- Son 5 hipotesis que se relacionan

  - **The Affective Filter Hypothesis**: the best acquisition will occur in environments where anxiety is low and defensiveness absent, "affective filter is low"
  
---
# Teoría #2: Output Hypothesis

- Swain and Lapkin (1995)

- "output serves an important role in SLA because it generates highly specific input the cognitive system needs to build up a coherent set of knowledge"


---
# Teoría #3: Attention-Processing Model (Cognitive)

- Their model juxtaposes processing mechanisms (controlled and automatic) and categories of attention to form four cells

- Controlled processes are "capacity limited and temporary" and automatic processes are relatively permanent

  - Controlled processing is typical of anyone learning a brand new skill in which only a very few elements of the skill can be retained
  
  - Automatic processing is a more accomplished skill where the "hard drive" of your brain can manage hundreds nad thousands of bits of information simultaneously

# Teoría #?: Implicit and Explicit Models

- **Explicit** knowledge: the facts that a person knows about language and the ability to articulate those facts in some way

  - Explicit processing differs from McLaughlin's focal attention in that explicit signals one's knowledge about language
  
- **Implicit** knowledge: information that is automatically and spontaneously used in language tasks

  - Children implicitly learn phonology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, etc. but do not have access to an explanation, explicitly, for those rules

# Teoría #4: Interaction Hypothesis

- Michael Long (1985, 1996)

- Comprehensible input is the result of modified interaction 

  - various modifications that native speakers and other interlocutors create in order to render their input comprehensible to learners 
  
- Interaction and input are 2 major players in the process of acquisition 

- Conversation and other interactive communication are the basis for development of linguistic rules 

---
# Teoría #4: Interaction Hypothesis

- The curriculum as interaction (Lier 1996)

- Zone of proximal development (ZPD) (Vygotsky 1978)

  - Learners construct the new language through socially mediated interaction

# Periodo crítico del lenguaje

¿Hay un período crítico - de mayor sensibilidad - para adquirir una lengua?

--

- Lenneberg (1967): el cerebro pierde plasticidad alrededor de la pubertad, de ahí que sea más difícil adquirir una lengua entonces

- El caso de Genie

- El lenguaje de señas nicaragüense

---
# Periodo crítico en la actualidad 

- Los casos de personas que adquirieron una lengua **con éxito** después de ese periodo (de la pubertad), modificaron la teoría:

- Existe un periodo crítico para la primera lengua

- Se habla de un **periodo ventajoso** para adquirir una lengua adicional.

--

  - Motivación
  
  - Frecuencia de uso
  
  - Comunidad de habla
  
  - Distancia entre la L1 y L2

---
# Estilos de aprendizaje

- "Theories of learning, Gangé's "types" of learning, transfer processes, and aptitude and intelligence models are all attempts to describe universal human traits in learning. They seek to explain globally how people perceive, filter, store, and recall information"

--

- Process: is characteristic of every human being, we all make stimulus-response connections and are driven by reinforcement

--

- Style: refers to the consistent and rather enduring tendencies or preferences within an individual, i.e., visually oriented, more tolerant of ambiguity, more refelctive, etc.

--

- Strategies: specific methods of approaching a problem or task, modes of operation for achieving a particular end, planned designs for controlling and manipulating certain information

---

- Cognitive Style

- Left- and Right-Brain Functioning

- Ambiguity Tolerance

# Factores socioculturales - social distance

- "Social distance emerged as an affective construct to give explanatory power to the place of culture learning in second language learning. [It] refers to the cognitive and affective proximity of two cultures that come into contact within an individual.

- John Schumann (1976): social distance consists of the following parameters

  - Dominance - In relation to the TL group, is the L2 group politically, culturally, technically or economically dominant, non-dominant, or subordinate?
  
  - Integration - Is the integration pattern of the L2 group assimilation, acculturation, or preservation? What is the L2 group's degree of enclosure - its identity separate from other contiguous groups?
  
  - Cohesiveness - Is the L2 group cohesive? What is the size of the L2 group?
  
  - Congruence - Are the cultures of the two groups congruent - similar in their value and belief systems? What are the attitudes of the two groups toward each other?
  
  - Permanence - What is the L2 group's intended length of residence in the target language area?

# Factores de cross-linguistic influencia 

- Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis: claims that the principal barrier to SLA is the interference of the L1 system with the L2 system, and that a scientific, structural analysis of the two languages in question would yield a taxonomy of linguistic contrasts between them which in turn would enable the linguist to predict the difficulties a learner would encounter

---

# Factores de cross-linguistic influencia 

- Existe una "hierarchy of difficulty" donde "a teacher or linguist could make a predction of the relative difficulty of a given asepct of the target language. 

- Level 0 = Transfer

- Level 1 = Coalescence

- Level 2 = Underdifferentiation

- Level 3 = Reinterpretation

- Level 4 = Overdifferentiation

- Level 5 = Split

---
# Factores de cross-linguistic influencia 

- **Level 0: Transfer** - no difference or contrast is present between the two languages. The learner can simply transfer (positively) a sound, structure, or lexical item from the native language to the target language. 

--
- ¿Ejemplos?

---
# Factores de cross-linguistic influencia 

- **Level 1: Coalescence** - Two items in the native language become coalesced into essentially one item in the target language. This requires that learners overlook a distinction they have grown accustomed to 

--
- ¿Ejemplos?

---
# Factores de cross-linguistic influencia 

- **Level 2: Underdifferentiation** - an item in the native language is absent in the target language. The learner must avoid that item.  

--
- ¿Ejemplos?

---
# Factores de cross-linguistic influencia 

- **Level 3: Reinterpretation** - An item that exists in the native language is given a new shape or distribution

--
- ¿Ejemplos?
---
# Factores de cross-linguistic influencia 

- **Level 4: Overdifferentiation** - a new item entirely, bearing little if nay similarity to the native language item, must be learned.

--
- ¿Ejemplos?

---
# Factores de cross-linguistic influencia 

- **Level 5: Split** - One item in the native language becomes two or more in the target language, requiring the learner to make a new distinction 

--
- ¿Ejemplos?

---
# Factores de cross-linguistic influencia 

- De CAH a Cross-Linguistic Influence (CLI)

--

- CLI suggests that we all recognize the significant role that prior experience plays in any learning act, and that the influence of the native languageas prior experience must not be overlooked.

# Reflexión para esta semana

- Pensad en las actividades que hicistéis en tus clases esta mañana, ¿se nota en la planificación que vuestros profes han pensando en diferentes poblaciones de aprendices? 

- Si sí, ¿cómo? Si no, ¿qué pudieron hacer diferente?
