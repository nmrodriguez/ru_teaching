# Criteria for textbook evaluation (cunningsworth, 1995)

- They should correspond to learners' needs and should match the aims and objectives of the language-learning program

- Should reflect the uses (present or future) which learners will make of the language. Textbooks should be chosen that will help equip students to use the language effectively for their own purposes

- Should facilitate the learning process, without imposing a rigid method

- Should have a clear role as a support for learning. Like teachers, they mediate between the target language and the learner
