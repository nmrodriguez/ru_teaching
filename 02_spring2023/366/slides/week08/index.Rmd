# Service-learning

- A union of community service and formal learning

- Involves getting students going out into their communities and using what they learn in class, to help people, and then bringing what they learn in their community service back into the classroom

--

- Service with learning objectives and learning with service objectives

---
# Service-learning 

- Young adult learners (especially at the university level) also need "the development of humane values"

- "Foremost among the purposes (of higher education) is that of giving young adults the skills and breadth of knowledge to think deeply about the structures of their society and to appropriate values which must govern their personal and professional lives (Berry and Chisolm, 1999)

- "Preparing the next generation for a lifelong commitment to productive citizenship is the most important challenge facing educators and communities at the local, regional, national, and global levels" (Berry and Chisolm, 1999)

# Service-learning in the Language Classroom

- To learn a language well, learners need meaningful contexts

- "Wherever possible, students should be placed in context-rich situations." - Latulippe (1999)

--

- "Facts and skills that are taught in isolation and not connected to something meaningful cannot be remembered without considerable practice and rehearsal... Second language classroom activities that are meaningful create an ideal learning opportunity for second language students to learn more information in a short time, with less effort." - Christison (1999)

---
# Service-learning in the Language Classroom

- Service-learning meets the two learner needs of (1) providing meaningful contexts and (2) draws out and cultivates humane values

- Fosters students' personal growth 

---
# Service-learning in the Language Classroom

- **Example**:

- Sacred Heart University's ESL curriculum has been using service-learning since 2000

- Students go to a local soup kitchen, elementary school, a tutoring agency, and a retirement community, a Habitat for Humanity construction project, or anything along those lines once a week

- In the classroom, students can discuss their feelings, thoughts, experiences, and observations from their service/work

- Their language tasks aren't sterile, isolated, or tedious, they are learning about and expressing their thoughts and ideas on issues of importance and personal relevance

- Make sure the service is really service

- Spend 3-4 consecutive weeks at the same worksite (build rapport)

- Provide meaningful language contexts (give students personal interactions!)

- Model the kind of involvement you want and expect

]

.pull-right[

- Challenge your students to take initiatives 

- Pair quiet students with more outgoing ones

- Have students keep a journal for taking notes on their experiences and reflections

- Make sure you bring service back into the classroom

- Be patient with your students and with the service-learning developments

# Reflexión

- Describe tu experiencia de servicio comunitario

- ¿Cuáles son las ventajas de involucrarse en la comunidad como "pre-service teachers"?

- Piensa en tu vida universitaria (y también en la escuela secundaria), ¿te hubieras gustado hacer más service-learning? ¿Por qué?
