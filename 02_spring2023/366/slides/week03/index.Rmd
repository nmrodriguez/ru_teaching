# Parte 1: La metodología

## donde empezamos y donde estamos 

---
# Donde empezamos 

- John Amos Comenius escribió un libro / creó un curso completo para aprender latin
  
  - Opera Didactica Omnia, 1657
  
  - Su teoría de adquisición de idiomas:
    
      - la adquisición se relaciona con la sensación y la experiencia 
      
      - la enseñanza debe ser oral 
      
      - hace falta fotos/modelos/etc. para adquirir vocabulario 
    
    - cambió la enseñanza de idiomas de un estudio de solamente gramática a algo intelectual

# Grammar–translation method

- Siglo 18 

.pull-left[
  - ¿Qué hacen los estudiantes? 
  
  - aprenden las reglas de la gramática de un idioma y luego traducen oraciones aplicando esas reglas 
  
  - estudiantes más avanzados tienen que traducir textos completos

]

.pull-right[
  - ¿Las metas?
  
  - 1. habilitar a los estudiantes a leer y traducir la literatura 
  
  - 2. "further students' general intellecutal development"
]

# Grammar–translation method

.pull-left[
  - ¿En qué lengua se da una clase? 
  
  - en la lengua nativa de los estudiantes 

]

.pull-right[
  - ¿Algo más?
  
  - Tests often involve translating classical texts
  
  - There is usually no listening or speaking practice, and very little attention is placed on pronunciation or any communicative aspects of the language. The skill exercised is reading and then only in the context of translation

# Grammar-translation method

#### ¿Qué opinamos? 

--

"Despite all of these drawbacks, the grammar–translation method is still the most used method all over the world in language teaching. That is unsurprising since most language proficiency books and tests are in the format of grammar–translation method."

# Direct Method

---
# Direct Method/Natural Method


- NO se usa la lengua nativa, solamente la L2

- It was adopted by key international language schools such as Berlitz, Alliance Française and Inlingua in the 1970s and many of the language departments of the Foreign Service Institute of the U.S. State Department in 2012.

- La enseñanza se enfoca en el desarrollo de lenguaje hablado (oral skills)

- "The direct method in teaching a language is directly establishing an immediate and audiovisual association between experience and expression, words and phrases, idioms and meanings, rules and performances through the teachers' body and mental skills, without any help of the learners' mother tongue."

---
class: center, middle 

"Direct method of teaching languages aims to build a direct way into the world of the target language making a relation between experience and language, word and idea, thought and expression rule and performance.
This method intends for students to learn how to communicate in the target language
This method is based on the assumption that the learner should experience the new language in the same way as he/she experienced his/her mother tongue without considering the existence of his/her mother tongue"

---
# Direct Method/Natural Method


- Características de este método:

  - teaching concepts and vocabulary through pantomiming, real-life objects and other visual materials
  
  - teaching grammar by using an inductive approach (i.e. having learners find out rules through the presentation of adequate linguistic forms in the target language)

  - the centrality of spoken language (including a native-like pronunciation)

  - focus on question–answer patterns

  - Concepts are taught by means of objects or by natural contexts through the mental and physical skills of the teacher only
  
  - Grammar is taught indirectly through the implication of the situation creation

---
# Direct Method/Natural Method

Actividades: 

- Question/answer exercise – the teacher asks questions of any type and the student answers.

- Dictation – the teacher chooses a grade-appropriate passage and reads it aloud.

- Reading aloud – the students take turns reading sections of a passage, play or a dialogue aloud.

- Student self-correction – when a student makes a mistake the teacher offers him/her a second chance by giving a choice.

- Conversation practice – the students are given an opportunity to ask their own questions to the other students or to the teacher. This enables both a teacher-learner interaction as well as a learner-learner interaction.

- Paragraph writing – the students are asked to write a passage in their own words.

---
# Direct Method/Natural Method

Good

- direct bond between contexts and helps in understanding directly what is heard and read
- Improves fluency of speech – fluency of speech results in easier writing, it tends to improve expression, expression in writing, and it is a quick way of learning and expanding vocabulary
- Aids reading – reading becomes easier and more pleasant, and it also promotes a habit of critical studying
- Improves the development of language sense
- Full of activities, which make it interesting and exciting
- Emphasizes the target language by helping the pupil express their thoughts and feelings directly in target language without using their mother tongue
- Develops listening, speaking, reading.
- Makes use of audio-visual aids and also facilitates reading and writing
- Facilitates alertness and participation of students

---
# Direct Method/Natural Method

Bad

- Ignores systematic written work and reading activities
- May not hold well in higher-level classes where the translation method may be more suitable
- Supports only limited vocabulary – it restricts the scope of vocabulary as not all words can be directly associated with their meanings
- Needs skilled teachers; e.g., less effective if teachers have a poor command of English
- Ignores reading and writing aspects of language learning
- Does not teach grammar systematically
- Time-consuming in creating real-life situations
- Less suitable for slow learners, who struggle with this method

# Audio-lingual method

- se basa en "behaviorist theory"

  - John B. Watson (1924), B.F. Skinner (1930)
  
  - Watson & Pavlov
  
  - which postulates that certain traits of living things, and in this case humans, could be trained through a system of reinforcement. The correct use of a trait would receive positive feedback while incorrect use of that trait would receive negative feedback.

# Audio-lingual method

- se basa en "behaviorist theory"

- "This approach to language learning was similar to another, earlier method called the direct method. Like the direct method, the audio-lingual method advised that students should be taught a language directly, without using the students' native language to explain new words or grammar in target language. However, unlike the direct method, the audio-lingual method did not focus on teaching vocabulary. Rather, the teacher drilled students in the use of grammar."

---

# Audio-lingual method

"Applied to language instruction, and often within the context of the language lab, it means that the instructor would present the correct model of a sentence and the students would have to repeat it. The teacher would then continue by presenting new words for the students to sample in the same structure. In audio-lingualism, there is no explicit grammar instruction: everything is simply memorized in form.

The idea is for the students to practice the particular construct until they can use it spontaneously. The lessons are built on static drills in which the students have little or no control on their own output; the teacher is expecting a particular response and not providing the desired response will result in a student receiving negative feedback. This type of activity, for the foundation of language learning, is in direct opposition with communicative language teaching."

---
# Audio-lingual method

Actividades: 

- Repetition: the student repeats an utterance as soon as he hears it.
- Inflection: one word in a sentence appears in another form when repeated.
- Replacement: one word is replaced by another.
- Restatement: the student rephrases an utterance.

# Understanding by Design

A framework for improving student achievement, emphasizing the teacher's critical role as a designer of student learning

Based on: 

  - A primary goal of education: development and deepening of student understanding
  
  - Student's understanding inrease with opportunities to explain, interpret, apply, shift persepctive, empathize, and self-assess
  
  - Effective curriculum development: a three-stage design process called "backward design"
  
---
# Backward Design

1. Identify desired results 

--

2. Determine acceptable evidence

--

3. Plan learning experiences and instruction

---
# Backward Design

- Start with the end in mind

- Align goals, assessment, activities

- Identify key questions for every unit

- Be flexible in choice of activities so long as goals are met


---
# Backward design

screen shot

---
# Backward design - Stage 1

What are the big ideas? 

What questions will foster inquiry, understanding, and transfer learning

What are the big ideas and important understandings participants should retain?

Identifying "what students will know" and most importantly "what students will be able to do"

---
# Backward design - Stage 1

Learning Objective Components:

A - audience (student centered)

B - behavior (observable and measurable)

C - conditions (how ill they do the task?)

d - degree (determines if success has been reached)


---
# Backward design - Stage 2

Determind acceptable evidence

- How do I check they have learned? How do I measure the result?

- Evidence of learning by assessment

- Performing tasks and evidence of understanding determine what the students will demonstrate and what evidence will prove their understanding

- This can include self-reflections and self-assessments on learning

# Backward design - Stage 3

Plan learning experiences and instruction

- How do I teach to achieve the learning outcomes? 

- How will students be "hooked"?

- Lists the learning activities that will lead to your desired results

- How will the work be "tailored" to individual interest and learning styles?

---
# Backward design - Stage 3

- What is the enabling needed to perform effectively and achieve desired results?

- What needs to be taught and coached? Determine the content

- How should it best be taught? - Instructional strategies

- What activities will equip students with these needed knowledge and skills?

- What materials and resources are best suited to accomplish these desired results/goals?

- Is the learning plan effective and engaging?

---
# Backward design Results

If followed completely, students should be able to answer the following questions:

- What are you doing? 

- Why are you being asked to do it?

- What will it help you do? 

- How does it fit into what you have previously done? 

- How will you show that you have learned it?
