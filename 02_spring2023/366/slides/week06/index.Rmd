# Parte 1: Competencia cultural

class: center, middle

"Paul Simon, in his provocative book *The Tounge-Tied American* (1980), recounts the story of a Georgia school board member who approached Genelle Morain of the University of Georgia with the question: 'Why should a student who will never leave Macon, Georgia, student a foreign language?" Her reply was succint but profound: 'That's *why* he should study another language'."

"This focus on the importance of cultural learning is rooted in at least two widely held beliefs among foreign language professionals: (1) that language study is essential component in the curriculum, in part because it can lead to greater cross-cultural understanding, and (2) that language and culture are inseparably intertwined."


"There is no question that the successful integration of culture and language teaching can contribute significantly to general humanistic knowledge, that language ability and cultural sensitivity can play a vital role in the security, defense, and economic well-being of this country, and that global understanding ought to be a mandatory component of basic education."
