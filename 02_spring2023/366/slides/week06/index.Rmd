# ¿Qué piensas cuando escuchas la palabra "test"?

---
# Tests

- "A method of measuring a person's ability, knowledge, or performance in a given domain."

--

- Testing and assessment are not synonymous 


--

- Informal vs formal assessment


--

- Formative vs Summative assessment


--

- Norm-references and criterion-referenced tests

--

- Communicative Language Testing

--

- Performance-Based Assessment

---
# Formative vs. Summative Assessment

- What is the function of the assessment? 

.pull-left[
**Formative**

- evaluating students in the process of "forming" their compretencies and skills with the goal of helping them to continue that growth process

- most of our classroom assessment is formative

- key is delivery (by the teacher) and internalization (by the student) of appropriate feedback on performance, with an eye toward the future continuation (or formation) of learning

- virtually all informal assessment should be formative

]

.pull-right[
**Summative**

- aims to measure, or summarize, what a student has grasped, and typically occurs at the end of a course or a unit of instruction

- implies looking back and taking stock of how well that student has accomplished objectives, but does not necessarily point the way to future progress

- final exams

# Principals of Language Assessment

- Practicality

- Reliability

- Validity

- Authenticity

- Washback

---
# Principals of Language Assessment

- **Practicality**: an effective test is practical

--

  - is not excessively expensive
  
  - stays within appropriate time constraints 
  
  - is relatively easy to administer 
  
  - has a strong scoring/evaluation procedure that is specific and time-efficient
  
---
# Principals of Language Assessment

- **Reliability**: consistent and dependable 

--

  - student-related reliability
  
  - rater reliability (inter-rater and intra-rater)
  
  - test administration reliability 
  
  - test reliability
  
---
# Principals of Language Assessment

- **Validity**: "the extent to which inferences made from assessment results are appropriate, meaningful, and useful in terms of purpose of the assessment"

--

- content-related evidence

- criterion-related evidence

- construct-related evidence

- consequential validity

- face validity

---
# Principals of Language Assessment

- **Authenticity**: "the degree of correspondence of the characteristics of a given language test task to the features of a target language task"

--

Authenticity may be present in the following ways:

- the language in the test is as natural as possible

- items are contextualized rather than isolated

- topics are meaningful (relevant, interesting) for the learner

- some thematic organization to items is provided, such as a story line or episode

- tasks represent, or closely approximate, real-world tasks

---
# Principals of Language Assessment

- **Washback**: the effect of testing on teaching and learning

--

- how students prepare for the test

- classroom instruction to prepare for the test

---
# To design a classroom language test:

- What is the purpose of the test?

--

- What are the objectives of the test? 

--

- How will the test specifications reflect both the purpose and the objectives?

--

- How will the test tasks be selected and the separate items be arranged?

--

- WHat kind of scoring, grading, and/or feedback is expected?

"Integrated Performance Assessment is a classroom-based performance assessment model developed by ACTFL that can be used for evaluating student's communication skills in the three modes of communication (Interpretive, Presentational, Interpersonal) identified in the World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages (2015). The World-Readiness Standards incorporate the Standards for Foreign Language Learning: Preparing for the 21st Century (1996), and Standards for Foreign Language Learning in the 21st Century (2006)."

--

Using a Backward Design approach, these IPA units begin with Goals of Instruction for the unit, and the final Performance Assessment. The unit template then shows how the 5 Cs of the Standards are integrated. The language functions, priority vocabulary, and sample learning activities students need to practice are also included.

---
# Characteristics of IPA

--

- **Authentic**: Reflect tasks that individuals do in the world outside the classroom

--

- **Performance-based**: Reflect how students *use* the language and cultural knoweldge in the communicative tasks

--

- **Based on the 3 modes of communication**: Interpretive, Interpersonal, Presentational

--

- **Blend with classroom instruction and experiences**: Teaching to the test (in a positive sense)
